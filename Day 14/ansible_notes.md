Q. Why Configuration Management came into existence?
Ans: Earlier for eg. upgrading, patching, installations we used to depend on shell/powershell scpting based on servers 
and based on distribution like for eg. Centos, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora we have to change the scipt. It used to become tedious
task when there are huge number of servers. To overcome this problem Configuration Managment tool like Ansible came into existence.

*Q. Why ansible is better than other configuration tools like Puppet?
Ans:  Main difference b/t ansible and puppet is as follows. 
Puppet:
1. It uses pull model
2. It followes master and slave agent based architecture
3. It it not that flexible with environments like Windows where we need to strech additionally to 
complete the tasks.
4. We need to learn additonal language which is puppet language.
Ansible:
1. It used push model.
2. It is follows agentless approch.
3. It is very much flexible with both linux/windows where we can find modules for Windows/linux easily 
when compared to Puppet.
4. It uses very simple yaml launguage which is widely used accross globe.
