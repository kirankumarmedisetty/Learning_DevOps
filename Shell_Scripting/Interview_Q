Q. Can we use pipe command to forward information of date command to second command?
Ans: No, it can't be possible because date is the default command of shell and it forwards to 'stdin' but not 'stdout'. 

Q. What is 'stdin' 'stdout' & 'stderr' in linux?
Ans: 'stderr' (shoft for standard error) is the stream used by programs to output error messages. 
By default, 'stderr' is also directed to the terminal screen. For example, if you try to list a non-existent directory using 
ls /nonexistentdirectory, the error message is sent to stderr and displayed on the terminal.

'stdout' (shoft for standard output) is the default stream where a program writes its output data. By default, this stream is directed to the terminal screen.
For example, when you run a command like echo "Hello, World!", the text "Hello, World!" is sent to stdout and displayed on the terminal.

Stdin (short for standard input) is an input stream where data is sent to and read by a program. It is a file descriptor in Unix-like operating systems
