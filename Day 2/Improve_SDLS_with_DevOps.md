Q. What is **SDLC**?
Ans: **SDLC** stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a standard used by IT industry to Design, Develop and Test for delevering high quality product.

Q. Key Phases/Stages of SDLC?
Ans: 1. **Planning and Requirement Analysis** (Business Analysis or Product Owner): This initial phase involves gathering and analyzing requirements from stakeholders to 
define the project's scope. It sets the foundation for the entire development process.
2. **Defining Requirements**: Detailed requirements are documented in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document, which serves as a reference for subsequent stages.
3. **Designing Architecture**: Based on the SRS, software architects create a Design Document Specification (DDS) outlining the system's architecture, user interface, and 
components. High Level Designing (HLD) and Low Level Designing (LLD) are decided by architects. 
4. **Development/Building**: Developers write code according to the design specifications. This phase involves using programming tools and adhering to coding standards.
5.**Testing and Integration**: The software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix defects. Integration ensures that all components work together seamlessly.
6. **Deployment and Maintenance**: The software is deployed in the production environment. Maintenance involves addressing issues, implementing updates, and ensuring the 
software remains functional over time.

Q. How DevOps imrpoves SDLC?
Ans: DevOps involvement in SDLC cycle is maninly at **Development/Building**, **Testing** and **Deployment** where he automates the process by deliverying them quickly.
